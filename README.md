## üìã About This Project

This is my second assignment for the Web Programming course at Istanbul Medipol University. The goal was to build small interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are three tasks, each focusing on different core concepts like form validation, DOM manipulation, and user input handling.
